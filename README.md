# LightPlus

A flashlight application built with Kotlin that allows users to perform a wide range of actions related to the flashlight of their phones.

This application allows you to use your phone's flashlight in an easy and intuitive way, for example, with my app, you can turn the flashlight on and off with just one click, as well as activate different flashing modes for emergency situations. You can also use the flashlight in strobe mode to give a strobe light effect to your parties or just communicate in Morse code.

### You can just [download the application here](https://github.com/Niskko/LightPlus/raw/main/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk) to test on your side
